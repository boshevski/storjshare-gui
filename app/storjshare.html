          <p><b>Last Updated: July 6, 2016</b></p>
          <p>PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU READ THESE STORAGE SHARING TERMS CAREFULLY.  NOTE THAT SECTION 15 CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER, WHICH AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.</p>
          <p>By installing the Software (defined below), you agree to be bound by these Storage Sharing Terms and all terms incorporated by reference.</p>
          <p>Storj Labs Inc. (“<b>Company</b>”) provides online storage services (“<b>Storage Services</b>”) to its users that enable users to store data and other materials (“<b>Storage Materials</b>”) via a distributed network of independently operated devices (“<b>Devices</b>”).  Each Device communicates with the Storage Services via open source software (“<b>Software</b>”) that is installed on the Device.  The Software enables a Device to rent extra storage space (“<b>Space</b>”) available on the Device to Company or directly to other third parties.  Company may use the Space it rents from you or may re-rent the Space it rents from you to other users via the Storage Services.</p>
          <p>These Storage Sharing Terms provide the terms pursuant to which you may rent Space to Company in connection with your use of the Software on any Device.  The Software may also permit you to rent Space directly to others, but these Storage Sharing Terms will not apply to those transactions.  If you never rent any Space to Company, only Sections 1 and 2 of these Storage Sharing Terms will apply to you.</p>
          <p>Please refer to our <a href="https://storj.io/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for information about how we collect, use and disclose information about you.</p>
          <p>You and Company agree as follows:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <h4>Agreement Process</h4>
              <p>In connection with your initial use of the Software, Company may provide notice of, and require you to affirm your agreement to, these Storage Sharing Terms.  You will not modify this notice and acceptance process, or the notice and acceptance process we may use in connection with any amendments we make to these Storage Sharing Terms (as further discussed in Section 18 below).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Eligibility; Authority</h4>
              <p>You represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years of age.  If you are entering into this agreement behalf of any entity: (a) you represent and warrant that you are authorized to accept these Storage Sharing Terms on such entity’s behalf and that such entity will be responsible for breach of these Storage Sharing Terms by you or any other employee or agent of such entity; and (b) references to “you” in these Storage Sharing Terms refer to you and such entity, collectively.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Software</h4>
              <p>The Software is licensed pursuant to the terms of an open source license agreement.  You will comply with any applicable license terms of the Software and any applicable documentation.  You will be solely responsible for satisfying all technical requirements of the Software, including any requirements in documentation provided with the Software, and for ensuring that the Software performs properly.

            <li>
              <h4>Storage Space</h4>
              <p>(a) By making available Space on your Device to rent via the Software, you authorize (i) Company and its users to store Storage Materials on your Device in accordance with any parameters you set via the Software installed on such Device; and (ii) Company and its users to access such Storage Materials from your Device at any time.</p>
              <p>(b) You represent and warrant that (i) you own or control your Devices, and have the right to install the Software on your Devices and rent out Space on your Devices pursuant to these Storage Sharing Terms, (ii) you are and will remain in compliance with all applicable laws in connection with your performance under these Storage Sharing Terms, and (iii) you will not breach any agreement to which you are a party in connection with your performance under these Storage Sharing Terms, including any agreement you have with a third-party Internet service provider.</p>
              <p>(c) When renting out Space to Company, you will ensure that (i) your Devices at all times meet any performance levels indicated in the Software documentation or instructions, (ii) your Devices will at all times be connected to the Internet to enable Company and its users to store and access the Storage Materials with 24x7 availability, and (iii) the use of the Internet by your Devices is not excessive so as to create network congestion or other form of Internet connectivity degradation.</p>
              <p>(c) By running the Software on your Devices and allowing Space to be utilized by Company and its users, you understand that your Devices may be impacted due to the additional constraints being placed on them by the Software and the processing of Storage Materials.  In particular, your Devices may not operate as quickly as they would without running the Software and making Space available for others to utilize.</p>
              <p>(d) In connection with your performance under these Storage Sharing Terms, you will comply with all applicable laws and third-party agreements to which you are bound.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Audits</h4>
              <p>You authorize the Storage Services to periodically audit the performance of your Device to ensure that you are in compliance with these Storage Sharing Terms and to ensure that the Storage Materials are being stored properly on your Device. You will not interfere with or disrupt any such audit.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Storage Materials</h4>
              <p>(a) We do not control, endorse, sponsor or adopt any Storage Materials, and we make no representations or warranties of any kind regarding such Storage Materials, including, without limitation, regarding its contents.  We have no obligation to screen, monitor or edit Storage Materials and are not responsible or liable for any Storage Materials.</p>
              <p>(b) You will not: (i) reverse engineer any aspect of the Storage Materials or do anything that might discover the contents or origin of the Storage Materials; (ii) attempt to bypass or circumvent measures employed to prevent or limit access to the Storage Materials, including by attempting to defeat any encryption; or (iii) attempt to interfere with the storage or transmission of Storage Materials or with our audits of your Device.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Compensation</h4>
              <p>(a) Subject to these Storage Sharing Terms, Company will pay you based upon the amount of Space utilized by Company and users of its Storage Services and the prices you have designated for such Space via the Software (“Storage Fees”).  We will pay the Storage Fees in one or more of the following, in our discretion: (i) Company’s proprietary virtual currency, called Storjcoin X (SJCX); (ii) Bitcoin (BTC); or (iii) U.S. dollars.</p>
              <p>(b) You represent and warrant that you are authorized to receive the Storage Fees in any payment method you designate via the Software that is acceptable to us (“Payment Method”).  If your Payment Method cannot be verified, is invalid, or is not otherwise acceptable, your right to receive payment of the Storage Fees may be suspended automatically.</p>
              <p>(c) You will be responsible for payment of all applicable taxes associated with our payment of Storage Fees, including any taxes on gross receipts or income.  Upon Company’s request, you will accurately and promptly complete and return to Company any tax forms indicated by Company.</p>
